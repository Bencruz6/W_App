    <h1>Cedar Planked Salmon

    <p>Cedar-planked salmon is a delicious and aromatic way to prepare salmon. The fish is seasoned with herbs, spices,
        and sometimes citrus, then placed on a soaked cedar plank, which imparts a smoky, woodsy flavor during cooking.
        The salmon is typically grilled or baked, allowing the wood to release its natural oils and infuse the fish with
        a subtle earthy aroma. The plank itself helps to keep the salmon moist, while the seasoning adds a burst of
        flavor. The result is a tender, flaky fish with a slightly smoky, savory edge that's perfect for a summer
        barbecue or a special dinner.

            ⅓ cup soy sauce
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
            1 ½ tablespoons rice vinegar
        </li>
        <li>
            1 teaspoon sesame oil
        </li>
        <li>
            ¼ cup chopped green onions
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
        </li>
        <li>
            1 teaspoon minced garlic
        </li>

        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>
        Steps
    </h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Gather all ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>
            Soak cedar planks for at least 1 hour in warm water. Soak longer if you have time.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir soy sauce, vegetable oil, rice vinegar, sesame oil, green onions, ginger, and garlic together in a
            shallow dish.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place salmon fillets in soy mixture and turn to coat. Cover and marinate for at least 15 minutes, or up to 1
            hour refrigerated.


        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat. Place planks on the grill grate. Heat planks until they start to
            smoke and crackle just a little.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove salmon from marinade and place on planks; discard marinade.
        </li>
        <li>
            Close grill cover. Grill salmon until it flakes easily with a fork, about 20 minutes; salmon will continue to cook after you remove it from the grill.


        </li>
