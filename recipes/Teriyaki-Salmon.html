    <p>
        Teriyaki salmon is a flavorful dish where salmon fillets are marinated in a sweet and savory teriyaki sauce,
        typically made with soy sauce, honey or sugar, garlic, ginger, and a touch of vinegar. The salmon absorbs the
        sauce, creating a glossy, caramelized coating when grilled, baked, or pan-seared. The result is a tender, juicy
        fish with a perfect balance of sweet, salty, and umami flavors. It's often served with rice and vegetables for a
        complete and satisfying meal.

        <li>
            1 teaspoon ground mustard
        </li>
        <li>
            1 teaspoon ground ginger
        </li>
        <li>
            ¼ teaspoon garlic powder

        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Mix sesame oil, lemon juice, soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame seeds, ground mustard, ginger, and garlic powder
            in a small saucepan over low heat. Bring to a simmer, stirring until sugar has dissolved. Set aside 1/2 cup
            of marinade for basting.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour remaining marinade into a resealable plastic bag. Add salmon steaks, coat with marinade, squeeze out
            excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
        </li>
        <li>
            Broil salmon steaks under the preheated broiler for 5 minutes, brushing salmon with reserved marinade. Turn
            and continue to broil until salmon is opaque and flakes easily, about 5 more minutes. Brush with marinade.
